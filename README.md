<!-- ===================== ABOUT ===================== -->

## About Me

Hi! I’m currently pursuing my **B.Tech in CSE (Data Science)** at  
**Malla Reddy Engineering College, Hyderabad**.

What began as a journey focused on learning and placements has evolved into a deeper purpose 
**building meaningful, scalable, and high-impact solutions through technology.**

My foundation lies in:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)**
- **Full-Stack Development (MERN Stack)**
- **SQL & NoSQL Database Design**
- Performance-focused backend architecture

I recently completed an internship with **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **EY GDS & AICTE**, where I gained hands-on experience in building scalable applications and understanding real-world engineering practices.

Hackathons and collaborative projects transformed my mindset   
from just writing code to **thinking in systems, scalability, and innovation.**

### What Drives Me Today

-  Solving complex problems through optimized logic  
-  Designing impactful, user-centered web applications  
-  Exploring AI-driven and intelligent systems  
-  Collaborating with ambitious and growth-oriented teams  

I believe learning is continuous  every conversation and project creates opportunity.

> **Let’s build technology that truly creates value.**
